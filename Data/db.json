      "title": "Know Your Customer: What Triggers them to Buy Your Products or Services",
      "body": "\n\nPicture this. You are scrolling through your social media and seeing a sponsored ad about running shoes simply because you opened one ad on your email or any other channel. On one fine day, you enter a shopping mall, see the same brand outlet and decide to have a look at some running shoes. After several thoughts later, you decide to make a purchase. This buying decision is what we call in marketing terminology ‘trigger’.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it is important to note that customers would not buy your product or service unless something causes them to buy. This is often overlooked, but trust us when we say that buying triggers are one of the most important pieces of information you can collect about your customer. Simply selling your product through different channels is not enough to attract and retain loyal customers. It requires a series of efforts to connect with your customers genuinely and build lasting relationships. Understanding this cycle within a digital landscape is extremely important if you want to avoid customer churn and wasted marketing investments. Read on to discover how.\nBreaking Down the Customer Buying Cycle\n\nThe customer buying cycle can be divided into three parts: awareness, consideration and decision. Have a glance at the infographic below for more information.\nAwareness\n\nAs the name denotes, awareness is the stage where your potential customer comes to know about the products or services you offer. They might not realise the urge to buy your product or service at this stage unless there is a trigger.  As a business entrepreneur, you need to paint a picture of the problem for your customers and gently introduce them to the solution while deepening brand awareness and building trust and loyalty.\nConsideration\n\nAt the consideration stage, your customer has realised that a problem needs to be addressed. The only challenge here is to ensure that your product or service is on top of your customer’s shopping list.\nDecision\n\nThe last stage, which is the decision stage, is where your customer either decides to buy your product or you might lose your customer to a competitor. Providing you have nurtured your customers well about your product, they finally decide to make a purchase at this stage. The role of your brand communication at the decision stage is to streamline the buying process and make them feel secure along the way.\nGuide to Trigger Marketing\n\nFrom boosting revenue to improving customer relationships, trigger marketing, if done correctly, can completely transform your marketing strategy. Here’s how to do it right:\nKnow Your Buyers’ Persona\n\nFirstly, you need to determine who your potential customers are you are trying to target. Once you know what kind of buyers you are trying to reach, you can think about the life cycle of those potential buyers. At the same time, you can gather insights into their problems and reasons.\nThink About the Causes and Effects\n\nNext, when strategising marketing triggers as part of your marketing strategy, your customers will either decide to buy your product or refuse to buy. At this stage, you need to determine what will happen and why. In other words, you need to chalk out why your customers either decided or declined your product and what made them make that decision.\nDescribe the Trigger Events\n\nFor valid reasons, you can not keep track of all your customers to check when they look at your social media channels. But you can keep track of other essential information, such as responses to emails, link-clicking, responses to campaigns, personal criteria and so on. You need to keep track of the things that can make your customers react. This way, you will be able to drive effective marketing campaigns for your brand.\nDetermine Automated Actions\n\nOnce you have noted down the triggers you want to respond to, you need to determine what course of action you will take. Analyse the list of triggers you made and then determine the plan of action you want to perform with respect to each trigger item.\nPersonalise Your Message\n\nSeveral studies have shown that personalised messages are more effective than bland and boring brand messages. If your action is a marketing task, knowing how a particular contact differs from the rest in your CRM and the message that might trigger them to perform the desired action is important.\nFocus on Customer Relationships\n\nCustomer relationship management, or CRM, is the best way to manage and improve your brand’s relationship with your customers. If you do not have a readily available system for managing things, your data will probably be all over the place. In this regard, you can make use of marketing automation software to take some burden off you and build effective customer relationships.\nParting Thoughts\n\nWelcome messages, monthly newsletters, abandoned shopping cart emails, birthday or anniversary emails, etc.; today, every interaction with your potential customer is also a chance to build robust and more personal customer dialogues. Whether a customer is buying your product, booking an appointment or simply scrolling through your website, they want to be listened to. Hence, it is important to run thorough research on what triggers them to purchase your product or the reason behind choosing any other brand’s product. At first, it might seem quite overwhelming, but eventually, you will be able to create more lasting relationships with your customers and cater to their needs more effectively and closely.\n",

      "title": " 7 Storytelling Techniques to Supercharge Your Pitch",
      "body": "In today's fast-paced business world, effective communication is crucial for success. When it comes to pitching your ideas, products, or services, storytelling is a powerful tool that can captivate your audience and leave a lasting impression. By incorporating storytelling techniques into your pitch, you can engage your listeners on an emotional level, make your message memorable, and increase the chances of achieving your objectives. This blog post will explore seven storytelling techniques to supercharge your pitch.\n\nStart With a Compelling Hook\n\nTo grab your audience's attention from the outset, begin your pitch with a compelling hook. This could be a personal anecdote, a thought-provoking question, or a powerful statement addressing a pain point or highlighting your proposition's benefits. The goal is to instantly pique the interest of your listeners and make them eager to hear more.\n\nDevelop Relatable Characters\n\nHumans connect with stories through the characters involved. When crafting your pitch, create relatable characters your audience can identify with. Whether it's a customer success story or a fictional persona, make sure the characters resonate with your listeners. Describe their challenges, aspirations, and how your solution or idea can positively impact their lives. This approach will help your audience see themselves in the story and increase their engagement with your pitch.\n\nUse Vivid Imagery and Sensory Language\n\nEngage your audience's senses by incorporating vivid imagery and sensory language into your pitch. Paint a vivid picture in their minds, allowing them to experience your story on an emotional level. Describing sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and textures can transport your listeners into the world you're creating, making your pitch more memorable and engaging. Appealing to their senses creates a deeper connection and makes your message more relatable.\n\nStructure Your Pitch as a Narrative Arc\n\nOne effective storytelling technique is structuring your pitch as a narrative arc. This involves setting up the context or problem, introducing the main characters (your customers or target audience), presenting the conflict or challenges they face, describing how your solution resolves those challenges, and showcasing the positive outcomes. This structure helps create a sense of progression, suspense, and resolution, keeping your audience engaged throughout.\n\nIncorporate Emotional Appeal\n\nEmotions have a powerful impact on decision-making, so tap into this by incorporating emotional appeal into your pitch. Whether it's through sharing personal stories, evoking empathy, or appealing to your audience's desires and aspirations, aim to create an emotional connection. Emotions such as joy, fear, hope, or excitement can influence your listeners' perceptions and actions, making them more receptive to your pitch.\n\nUse Data and Statistics Effectively\n\nWhile storytelling is crucial, backing your claims with data and statistics adds credibility and reinforces your pitch. Use relevant and compelling data points to support your story and make it more persuasive. By incorporating statistics or case studies, you can provide evidence of your solution's effectiveness, market potential, or customer satisfaction. However, ensure that the data is presented in a digestible and understandable manner, avoiding overwhelming your audience with excessive information.\n\nEnd With a Memorable Takeaway\n\nTo ensure your pitch lingers in your audience's minds, end with a memorable takeaway. Summarise your key points, highlight the value you offer, and leave your listeners with a clear call to action. This takeaway should encapsulate the essence of your pitch, reminding your audience of the impact your idea or solution can have. Whether it's a catchy phrase, a thought-provoking question, or a powerful closing statement, ensure it resonates and encourages further engagement.\n\nIncorporating storytelling techniques into your pitch can elevate your communication skills and enhance your chances of success. By starting with a compelling hook, developing relatable characters, using vivid imagery and sensory language, structuring your pitch as a narrative arc, incorporating emotional appeal, using data effectively, and ending with a memorable takeaway, you can supercharge your pitch and leave a lasting impression on your audience.\n\nRemember, effective storytelling is a skill that can be honed with practice, so embrace these techniques, unleash your creativity, and captivate your listeners with the power of storytelling.",

      "body": "The World Wide Web and tcreated the first “blog” in 1992 to outline and render visible the ongoing development of the Web and the software necessary to navigate this new space. Web history, especially the early growth of Web servers and sites, is chronicled on the various “What’s New” pages in the archives of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Another example of a blog that existed before the word was coined is Slashdot. Following its debut in September 1997, Slashdot operated as a clearinghouse for information in its “News for Nerds,” with a small set of editors who decided what to publish of numerous articles and news items submitted by the “geek” community. Indeed, Web sites mentioned on Slashdot were often overwhelmed, leading to a condition now known as being “slashdotted.”\n\nIn December 1997, Jorn Barger, an early online presence, coined the term web log to describe his Web site RobotWisdom.com. In early 1999 another individual with considerable online experience, Peter Merholz, began to employ the term blog on his site Peterme.com. While the history of the term is pretty well settled, the same cannot be said of the identity of the first blogger. Depending on the definition of a blog, Berners-Lee may not qualify as the first blogger. Claimants to this title include Justin Hall, a college student who started an online list at links.net in 1994; Carolyn Burke, who began publishing Carolyn’s Diary online in 1995; and Dave Winer, who has published Scripting News online since April 1, 1997.\n\nThe growth of the blogosphere has been nothing short of remarkable. Technorati, Inc., a Web site and organization dedicated to mapping and searching the blogosphere, found that by October 2005 there were 19.6 million blogs, a number that has been doubling roughly every five months. Approximately 70,000 new blogs are created each day—or, more vividly, nearly one every second. Also of importance is the growth of blogs in languages other than English, especially Chinese.\n\nDespite the overwhelming number of blogs, very few individuals make a living as a blogger. A few individuals earn money from their Web sites by carrying ads and appeals for funds, and some blogs are financed by corporate or organizational owners; nevertheless, most bloggers derive nonmonetary rewards from their activity. In particular, blogs offer ordinary individuals the ultimate soapbox and an opportunity to create their own digital identity or personal brand.\n\nOne reason for the proliferation of blogs is the ease with which they can be established and maintained. Many services and software systems are available that allow an individual to set up a blog in less than an hour. Of course, updating a blog is essential for maintaining its presence and importance. Statistics on blogs that are started but not updated remain elusive, but the proportion is undoubtedly substantial.\n\nLike the fad for personal Web pages in the 1990s, the proliferation of blogs has led to the creation of Web sites that group blogs, often with a similar political emphasis or subject orientation, to form “superblogs.” An example of this phenomenon is The Huffington Post, founded in 2005 by American author and syndicated newspaper columnist Arianna Huffington, which hosts dozens of other bloggers who post mostly on politics and current affairs.",

      "title": "World Bank country classifications by income level for 2024-2025",
      "body": "The World Bank Group assigns the world’s economies[1] to four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. The classifications are updated each year on July 1, based on the GNI per capita of the previous calendar year. GNI measures are expressed in United States dollars[2] using conversion factors derived according to the Atlas method, which in its current form was introduced in 1989[3]. The World Bank’s income classification aims to reflect a country’s level of development, drawing on Atlas GNI per capita as a broadly available indicator of economic capacity.\n\nThe classification of countries into income categories has evolved significantly over the period since the late 1980s. In 1987, 30% of reporting countries were classified as low-income and 25% as high-income countries. Jumping to 2023, these overall ratios have shifted down to 12% in the low-income category and up to 40% in the high-income category. \n\nThe scale and direction of these shifts, however, varies a great deal between world regions. Here are some regional highlights:\n\n    100% of South Asian countries were classified as low-income countries in 1987, whereas this share has fallen to just 13% in 2023.\n\n    In the Middle East and North Africa there is a higher share of low-income countries in 2023 (10%) than in 1987, when no countries were classified to this category.\n\n    In Latin America and the Caribbean, the share of high-income countries has climbed from 9% in 1987 to 44% in 2023.\n\n    Europe and Central Asia has a slightly lower share of high-income countries in 2023 (69%) than it did in 1987 (71%).\n     \n\nThese changing compositions are depicted visually in the diagram below, which shows country classifications by region and over time since 1987.\n \nFlourish logoA Flourish chart\n\n\nClassification changes\n\nThe updated country income classifications for FY25, based on the GNI per capita of 2023, are available here.\n\nFrom a statistical perspective, classifications can change for two reasons:\n\n    Changes to Atlas GNI per capita: In each country, factors such as economic growth, inflation, exchange rates, and population growth can all influence the level of Atlas GNI per capita. Revisions to improve methods and data can also have an impact. Updated data on Atlas GNI per capita for 2023 can be accessed here.\n\n    Changes to classification thresholds: To keep income classification thresholds fixed in real terms, they are adjusted annually for inflation using the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) deflator, a weighted average of the GDP deflators of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro Area. The new thresholds for Atlas GNI per capita (in US$) are as follows:\n     \n\nThe chart below shows the economies moving to new income categories this year:\n \nFlourish logoA Flourish scatter chart\n\n\nThis year, three countries—Bulgaria, Palau, and Russia—moved from the upper-middle-income to the high-income category:\n\n    Bulgaria has been steadily approaching the high-income threshold with modest growth throughout the post-pandemic recovery period, which continued in 2023 as real GDP grew 1.8%, supported by consumption demand.\n\n    Palau also continued its post-pandemic recovery as GDP returned to previous levels, growing by 0.4% in real terms. With inflation (as measured by the GDP deflator) at 8.1%, nominal GNI increased 10.0%.\n\n    Economic activity in Russia was influenced by a large increase in military related activity in 2023, while growth was also boosted by a rebound in trade (+6.8%), the financial sector (+8.7%), and construction (+6.6%). These factors led to increases in both real (3.6%) and nominal (10.9%) GDP, and Russia’s Atlas GNI per capita grew by 11.2%.\n     \n\nAlgeria, Iran, Mongolia, and Ukraine all moved up from the lower-middle-income to the upper-middle-income category this year: \n\n    While the Algerian economy grew 4.1% in 2023, the main reason for the upward reclassification was a comprehensive revision to national accounts statistics undertaken by the Algerian authorities (Office National des Statistiques) to align with current international standards. This realignment resulted in an upward revision to the level of GDP (on average 13.3% higher over the 2018-2022 period) due, for example, to the expansion of investment estimates to include research and development, improved methods for measuring production in public administration, and improved coverage of the non-observed economy.\n\n    Iran’s economy grew 5.0% in 2023, driven mainly by oil exports and supported by gains in services and manufacturing. GNI jumped 39.5% in nominal terms which, combined with the depreciation of the Iranian rial, resulted in a 17.6% increase of the Atlas GNI per capita.\n\n    Mongolia continued its recovery after the pandemic, with real GDP increasing 7.0% in 2023. Growth was driven by expansions in mining of 23.4%, along with higher export prices which boosted exports by 53.4%.\n\n    Ukraine’s upward change in classification resulted from a resumption of economic growth in 2023 (real GDP grew 5.3%, following a drop of 28.8% in 2022) along with a continued decline in population, which has fallen more than 15% since the invasion from Russia began. These factors were further amplified by price increases of domestically produced goods and services to result in a large increase in nominal Atlas GNI per capita of 18.5%. While Ukraine’s economy was significantly impaired by Russia’s invasion, real growth in 2023 was driven by construction activity (24.6%), reflecting a sizable increase in investment spending (52.9%) supporting Ukraine’s reconstruction effort in the wake of ongoing destruction.\n\n\nWest Bank and Gaza was the only country whose classification moved downward this year. The conflict in the Middle East began in October 2023, and while the impact on West Bank and Gaza was limited to the fourth quarter, its scale was nonetheless sufficient to lead to a 9.2% drop in nominal GDP (-5.5% in real terms). Since West Bank and Gaza’s economy was close to the threshold (it entered the upper-middle-income category only last year), these declines brought Atlas GNI per capita back down to the lower-middle-income category.\n\nMore information\n\nDetailed information on how the World Bank Group classifies countries is available here. The country and lending groups page provides a complete list of economies classified by income, region, and World Bank lending status and includes links to prior years’ classifications. The classification tables include World Bank member countries, along with all other economies with populations greater than 30,000. These classifications reflect the best available GNI figures for 2023, which may be revised as countries publish improved final estimates.\n\nData for GNI, GNI per capita, GDP, GDP PPP, and Population for 2023 are now available on the World Bank's Open Data Catalog. Note that these are estimates and may be revised. For more information, please contact us at data@worldbank.org.\n\n \n\n\n\n[1] The term country, used interchangeably with economy, does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics.\n[2] In countries where dual or multiple exchange rates are in use, the exchange rate used to convert local currency units to US$ is an average of these exchange rates, provided necessary data are available.\n[3] For data beginning in reference year 1987.\n\nThe authors are pleased to acknowledge the essential contributions of our colleagues, Charles Kouame, and Tamirat Yacob to the preparation of this piece.\n\nPlease note: The country classification described here aims to serve analytical purposes and changes have no direct impact on the eligibility for World Bank resources. In the classification used for World Bank operational purposes, a range of additional criteria are considered to determine country eligibility and the terms and conditions of Bank financing.
